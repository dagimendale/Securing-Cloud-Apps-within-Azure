# Creating and Securing a Web App within Azure
In this project I am building, hosting, and desinging my own web application within Azure. I started this project by setting up my Azure account and then familiarizing myself with the Azure environment.

This project begins by looking for "app services" within the search field and selecting  "+ Create" to begin teh creation of the Web App.
