# Creating and Securing a Web App within Azure
In this project I am building, hosting, and desinging my own web application within Azure. The preliminary work of this project was just setting up my Azure account with a subscription and resource group, then afterwards further familiarizing myself with the Azure environment.(check prerequisites)

PART 1: Creating an Azure Web app

1. As the two following images reveal, this project begins by typing in "App Services" into the search field and then once within App Services selecting the "+ Create" option.

2. Now within the "Basics" section I selected my subscription and my previously created resource group. I then created the domain name, code for publish, "PHP 8.2" for the Runtime Stack, Linux for the OS, and the region associated to my resource group. Afterwards, I selected the sevice pricing plan which I put as Basic B1 option and every other section I left as default, leading to me finally selecting the create option. The newly created resource was provided with the cutom domain name we made earlier, as well as a unique IP address.
