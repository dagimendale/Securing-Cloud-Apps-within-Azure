# Creating and Securing a Web App within Azure
In this project I am building, hosting, and desinging my own web application within Azure. The preliminary work of this project was just setting up my Azure account with a subscription and resource group, then afterwards further familiarizing myself with the Azure environment.(check prerequisites)

PART 1: Creating an Azure Web app

1. As the two following images reveal, this project begins by typing in "App Services" into the search field and then once within App Services selecting the "+ Create" option.

2. Now within the "Basics" section I selected my subscription and my previously created resource group, then created the web app name, code for publish, "PHP 8.2" for the Runtime Stack, Linux for the OS, and the region associated to my resource group.
